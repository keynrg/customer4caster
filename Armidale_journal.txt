## GENERAL INFORMATION ##
The given datasets are 15-min electricity usage of Armidale school in three consecutive years (2017, 2018, and 2019) 

When working on this project, there were two tasks that I need to finish:
  1. Make a 60-timestep predictor to see the general trend of electricity demand in the next 12 hours.
  2. Make a 12-timestep predictor to see the predicted values of electricity demand in the next 3 hours so that
    the battery's algorithm can make right decision.
  3. Output the predictions to a database

Some suggested subtasks are:
  a. Use the temperature variable.
  b. Create and use holiday variable?
  c. Make seasonal prediction
  d. Make a shifting plot which how close the "moving_window" predict (see shifting_plot.py in the repo)

The project started.

I found that just splitting the dataset into X_train and y_train without any preprocessing would easily cause overfitting.
Therefore, I tried to split the dataset into seasons, train and predict with each season, which did wonder: 
the mean_RMSE significantly dropped, especially that of the summer because of how I subset it.
The multivariate model (history and temperature) wasn't as good as the univariate (history) model.

-- Mar 24, 2020 --
I built the shifting_plot() function. 
I also noticed that multivariate model (history and temperature) can give better near predictions. UwU
