This python code will scrape the "NSW ELECTRICITY PRICE AND DEMAND" table from AEMO 
<https://www.aemo.com.au/aemo/apps/visualisations/elec-nem-priceanddemand.html> 
through an API and save the table to your computer.

It also supports scraping data of the other states by changing the parameter of ad_hoc(region = 'NSW1') function
to the abbreviation of the state, appending '1'. E.g VIC1 / QLD1 / SA1 / TAS1.

Great thanks to facebook user Sirichai Sasataradol who helped me to finish the code.
